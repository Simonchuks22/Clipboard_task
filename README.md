## My process
To Attempt it you need the basic understanding of HTML and CSS 
1) first of all structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
2)link your CSS with HTML file and write note all CSS properties This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
3)Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
4) Create a GITHUB Repository,Creating a repo will make it easier to share your code and host it. 
5) Then push your codes to github repo using GIt and deploy it
